# inspirational-quote-machine
A web app that hand-delivers you a random positive and forward-looking quote to help brighten up your day.

[08/06/22]

Added a new branch which will (at the time of writing) hold an updated version of this app, and will begin the basis of a bigger, better and bolder quote-based app quite soon.

The updated version will simply pull a random quote tagged 'inspirational' from a quote API called 'Quotable' and disply the quote and the name of the author.
